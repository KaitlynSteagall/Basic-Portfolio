      <p class="bio">    My name is Kaitlyn Steagall, I was born in Albany, OR January, 12 1994. I moved up to Tigard, OR when I started middle school and I now live in Aloha, OR with Kent, my boyfriend of three and a half years, my dog Sherman, my cat Lilly, my ferret Bonnie, and my fish Stanlee. I love animals so I'm happy I get to come home to them everyday! <br><br> I love collecting rocks, shells, and four-leaf clovers so half the time when I'm outside I'm looking down. Another thing I started to collect is fridge magnents! I have at least ten right now.<br><br> I also love music. I love all music, and not the fake "I love music" either, I listen to and enjoy common dislikes such as metal, country, classical, etc. My favorite genre though is probably Alternative or Punk. I played the violin for eight years and also used to know a bit on the guitar, but I haven't practiced in a few years, so I'm out of touch with my skills. <br><br> Another thing I haven't practiced in a while, but also used to really enjoy, was flying Cessna 172s. It's the best feeling to be up in the air and it's thrilling to do your first power-on and power-off stalls. Maybe someday I'll get some more hours in my log, but life is so busy busy busy!!! When I'm able to go with the flow is when I'm my happiest. We just got to keep on keeping on.</p>
